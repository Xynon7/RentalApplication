Wish List allows you to save items that are currently not available to rent or save items that are not for rent on the application yet by letting you specify a brand, a type, a cost window, and a descriptive phrase (like blue, queen size or seats eight) for the item you want to rent. &#x0a; &#x0a;



Profile gives you access to your username, locations - which allows you to add a new location and view your saved locations, results - which lets you see the results of searches you have made in the past, carts - which lets you see which items you have ready for checkout and your average user rating - this is calculated from your average renter and or lessor rating. &#x0a; &#x0a;
