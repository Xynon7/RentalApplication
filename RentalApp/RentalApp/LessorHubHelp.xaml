Messages allows you to see and send messages to other users on this application. &#x0a; &#x0a;
 


Exchanges allows you to see past and current exchanges and allows you to create and submit a new exchange. &#x0a; &#x0a;



New item listing allows you to offer a new item for exchange - you can enter its brand, type, condition, replacement cost and images. &#x0a; &#x0a;



Items listed allows you to see the items you have listed for exchange on this application. &#x0a; &#x0a;



Rate a Renter allows you to rate a renter you have leased to based on how good or bad the exchange and communication went with them - this is used to calculate a renter's average rating and is used to calculate a user's overall average rating. &#x0a; &#x0a;



Lessor Agreement lets you agree to or view the lessor agreement required to lease on this application. &#x0a; &#x0a;



Average lessor rating is your average rating as a lessor and is calculated from how renters have rated you when they either exchanged an item with you or communicated with you."
